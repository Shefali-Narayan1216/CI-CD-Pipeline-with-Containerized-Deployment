# CI-CD-Pipeline-with-Containerized-Deployment
**Skill Set:** Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), Jenkins/GitHub Actions, AWS CloudFront, Route 53

**Technology:** AWS EKS, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CloudFront, Route 53
**USE CASES**
This project demonstrates a real-world CI/CD automation pipeline for containerized microservices, integrating Jenkins/GitHub Actions, Docker, ECR, and EKS. The system ensures zero-downtime deployments, global availability through CloudFront and Route 53, secure secret management with AWS Secrets Manager, and proactive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana. Auto-scaling and spot-instance optimization provide both high availability and cost efficiency.
